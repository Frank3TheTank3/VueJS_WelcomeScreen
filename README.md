# Project Welcome_Screen for Opportunity

This project was made for the display in our office entrance. It's a vertical screen with the dimensions: 1080 x 1920 px.
The API we use to show the information on screen is referenced through Google Sheets and is dynamically updated every hour
with our intergrated functions.

By using Vue JS as the main framework and adding CSS Animations I was able to create an appliaction capable of being
very efficiently run as well as bringing an attractive design to the table (the table in the entrance).

Our hamster runned servers deliver a unique customer experience and by using the npm build function you can
also check out this renewed entrance screen for the junior developer internship at Opportunity ZH.
